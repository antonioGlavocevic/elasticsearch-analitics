#################### Packetbeat Configuration Example #########################

# This file is an example configuration file highlighting only the most common
# options. The packetbeat.reference.yml file from the same directory contains all the
# supported options with more comments. You can use it as a reference.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/packetbeat/index.html

#============================== Network device ================================

# Select the network interface to sniff the data. On Linux, you can use the
# "any" keyword to sniff on all connected interfaces.
packetbeat.interfaces.device: any

#================================== Flows =====================================

# Set `enabled: false` or comment out all options to disable flows reporting.
packetbeat.flows:
  # Important! DT (clear all the unnecessary reporting)
  enabled: false

  # Set network flow timeout. Flow is killed if no packet is received before being
  # timed out.
  timeout: 30s

  # Configure reporting period. If set to -1, only killed flows will be reported
  period: 10s

# Important! DT (clear all the unnecessary reporting)
packetbeat.ignore_outgoing: true

#========================== Transaction protocols =============================

packetbeat.protocols:
- type: http
  # Configure the ports where to listen for HTTP traffic. You can disable
  # the HTTP protocol by commenting out the list of ports.
  ports: [9200]
  send_headers: ["Cookie", "Set-Cookie"]
  split_cookie: true
  include_body_for: ["application/json"]

#==================== Elasticsearch template setting ==========================

setup.template.settings:
  index.number_of_shards: 1
  #index.codec: best_compression
  #_source.enabled: false

#setup.template.name: "packetbeat"
#setup.template.pattern: "packetbeat-*"


#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards is disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
setup.dashboards.enabled: false

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. By default this URL
# has a value which is computed based on the Beat name and version. For released
# versions, this URL points to the dashboard archive on the artifacts.elastic.co
# website.
#setup.dashboards.url:

#============================== Kibana =====================================

# Starting with Beats version 6.0.0, the dashboards are loaded via the Kibana API.
# This requires a Kibana endpoint configuration.
#setup.kibana:

  # Kibana Host
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 5601)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:5601/path
